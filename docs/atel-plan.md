# Atel language plan

Goal: turn every compiled ATEL script of FFX (events, monster AI, battle
scripts) back into source code that reads like what the developers meant,
and compile that source back into the same bytes. The source language is
**Atel: standard C#, restricted to what ATEL can run**, parsed and checked
by Roslyn and compiled by our own backend to ATEL bytecode. Atel then
becomes the language mods are written in.

This replaces the Lua plan of 2026-10-31 and stages L2 ("Atel to Luau")
and L3 ("Luau to Atel") in `docs/rewrite-plan.md`, "Scripting for
modders". Accepted 2026-11-01.

## Decisions (user)

2026-10-31:

- **Close to C#.** Most modders, including the Fahrenheit community, know
  C#.
- **Byte-identical round trip** is the acceptance bar: decompile, compile,
  and get the original script block and containing file back, for every
  script.
- **The decompiled source lives in a private GitHub repo,
  `yutamago/ffx-atel-src`**, versioned. Claude may create it when the time
  comes. No decompiled output goes into `ffx-rust`.
- **Mods change things, they don't replace files.** Vanilla files stay
  untouched; mods are composed in load order (as the size tables already
  are, `docs/hooking.md`).
- Work starts when the user says so.

2026-11-01 (replacing the custom syntax of the first version):

- **Standard C#, not a C#-like language.** Files are `.cs`, projects are
  `.csproj`, and Rider, Visual Studio and VS Code work unchanged. The
  subset that compiles to ATEL is enforced by analyzers. Precedent:
  UdonSharp (C# through Roslyn to VRChat's Udon VM), Unity Burst.
- **The language tooling is written in C#** (.NET 10): decompiler,
  compiler, analyzers, the game's reference assembly, the mod linker. Rust
  keeps what runs inside the game: the interpreter, the hook and the
  existing `ffx-script` crate.
- **Mods ship compiled.** Players need neither a compiler nor a decompiler;
  the launcher links compiled mod packages onto the player's own files.

## What the bytecode says about the original language

From all 758 scripts (17.3 million instructions, 57.9 MB of script
sections; survey 2026-10-31):

- C expressions and types: `+ - * / %`, comparisons, `&& ||` (not
  short-circuit), `& | !`, `<<`; separate signed and unsigned compares;
  variables typed `u8`…`f32` in storage areas.
- Arrays with nested indexing (742k element reads), `&var` passed to
  natives (2k).
- `if` (every conditional forward jump, 405k), loops (64k backward jumps),
  `switch` (selector in register B, compare chain after the case bodies,
  598k backward case jumps; every chain ends in a `jmp`, so `default`
  likely exists).
- Locals in 4 int and 10 float registers per worker; shared subroutines
  (`call`, argument in `i0`); `return value`.
- Workers with numbered entries; requests between workers with 9 priority
  levels (`req` 79k, `reqe` 25k, `reqw` 2.9k).
- Constant folding, small immediates, a breakpoint opcode (a debugger).
- No strings (messages are IDs), no pointers beyond `&var`, no structs.

## The language

Everything below is valid C#; what makes it Atel is the reference assembly
(the game's API) and the analyzers (what ATEL can run).

### Scripts, files and order

- A script is a namespace and a folder, one file per worker:
  `Events/Bj/Bjyt0400/Bjyt0400.cs`, `Wakka.cs`, `Lulu.cs`, each starting
  with `namespace Events.Bj.Bjyt0400;`.
- The main file holds the script class, which names the file and the
  worker order once; a worker's position is its number. Its static fields
  are the variables shared by all workers (storage 6):

  ```csharp
  [Event("bjyt0400")]
  [Workers(typeof(Director), typeof(Wakka), typeof(Lulu))]
  static partial class Bjyt0400
  {
      public static int TimesTalked;
  }
  ```

  Monsters and battle scripts use `[Monster("m001")]` and
  `[Battle("cdsp00_00")]`.
- `partial class` splits a big worker over several files; `using
  Ffx.Battle;` imports the libraries.
- How many scripts go into one project (one compilation) is measured in
  Phase 6: the whole corpus at once is likely too much for an IDE.

### Workers and entries

- A worker is a `class`. Its base class says what it is (`Npc`, `Monster`,
  …; one per worker type, see "Worker types"); function workers are
  `static class`es.
- Entries the engine calls by number are virtual base class members and
  use `override`: `Init` (entry 0, run at priority 7), `Main` (entry 1,
  priority 0), talk, touch, battle turns, … Other entries are `async`;
  plain methods are helpers (see "Three kinds of code").
- Entry numbers are implicit (base class first, then files in path order,
  then declaration order). `[Entry(n)]` only where a specific number is
  wanted; the decompiler writes it only where the rule would differ.
- A base class can provide default entries (a monster without `Main`
  waits for ever), emitted only when the bytes match.

### Worker types

Seven types (worker header `+0x00`), in the 758 scripts:

| Type | Workers | Known |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 441 (events) | **function worker**: every `call` (5,560) targets one, and each has exactly one entry; becomes a `static class` |
| 1 | 6,707 (events) | |
| 2 | 648 (events), 898 (monsters: every monster worker) | |
| 3 | 486 (events) | |
| 4 | 1,944 (events) | no position block |
| 5 | 1,382 (events) | position block and walk-line table (characters) |
| 6 | 116 (events) | as 5 |

Phase 0 names the rest from the natives each type calls; the `battle/btl`
scripts are counted then too.

### Three kinds of code

ATEL entries are not functions: each runs on its own worker when that
worker gets to it. The language keeps the original's three kinds apart:

| Kind | Declared as | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| Function worker (type 0) | `static class Common { public static void SetupModels(int mode) { … } }` | synchronously on the caller's worker (`call`) |
| Helper method (new code) | a plain method in a class: `void FaceThePlayer() { … }` | synchronously; the compiler makes it a hidden function worker and `call`s it |
| Entry | `override` (engine-run) or `async Task NameAsync()` (requestable) | on its own worker, through a request |

`call` limits apply to static functions and helpers: at most 3 deep, no
recursion (analyzer error), no `await` on them.

### Parameters and return values

ATEL passes neither: `call` shares the caller's registers, and a request
carries only entry, worker and priority. The compiler provides both:

- **Functions and helpers:** parameters in registers (up to 4 `int` and 10
  `float`, minus those the caller still needs, which the compiler saves),
  the return value in `i0` or `f0`. Synchronous, so always safe.
- **Entries:** parameters and the return value go through hidden fields of
  the receiving worker, written at the request and read after
  `.Finished`. Safe while one request at a time is pending for that entry.
  The compiler sees every caller (requests stay within one script), so it
  warns when two callers could have the same entry pending at once. A
  return value requires waiting for `.Finished`.
- Decompiled code has neither (the original had none); this is for new
  code only.

### Requests between workers

- `Task` and `Task<T>` here are the reference assembly's own task-like
  types (`Ffx.Atel.Task`, with `[AsyncMethodBuilder]`), not .NET's; the
  projects do not import `System.Threading.Tasks`.
- An entry other workers may run is declared `async Task NameAsync()`
  (`async Task<int> NameAsync(int x)` with a parameter and a result).
- `_ = Lulu.LookAtWakkaAsync();` queues it and carries on (`req`).
- `await Lulu.LookAtWakkaAsync();` or `await Lulu.LookAtWakkaAsync().Finished;`
  waits until it ends (`reqe`).
- `await Lulu.LookAtWakkaAsync().Started;` waits until it begins (`reqw`).
- A request without `await` or `_ =` gets a hint (as C#'s own CS4014).
  Requesting an entry that is not `async` is an error.
- A worker can request its own entries (641 `req`, 130 `reqe` in the
  shipped scripts). Awaiting one works only at a priority above the one
  the worker runs at: it interrupts, runs, and the caller continues. At the
  same or a lower priority it cannot start while the caller waits (to
  confirm in Phase 0); the analyzer reports that as an error where it
  knows the caller's priority (`Main` P0, `Init` P7) and warns elsewhere.
  A helper method is usually the better choice.
- Priorities: `Priority.P0_Main` … `Priority.P8_…`, an enum, zero-based,
  sorted by level, names after the number from Phase 0. P1–P6 are for
  scripts; P0 (`Main`'s level), P7 (`Init`, battle system) and P8 (unused)
  compile with a warning. An optional parameter with a common default makes
  most calls omit it.
- `await` on something that cannot be awaited (a native that waits anyway,
  a function or helper) is dropped, with a hint. In C# terms these return
  an awaitable that completes at once.

### Variables

- Fields live in the script's data (storage 2, 3, 4), with initial values
  as field initializers; the script class's static fields in the shared
  area (storage 6).
- `[Register] int Count;` / `[Register(2)] int Count;` puts a field in one
  of the worker's registers; the compiler assigns slots in declaration
  order unless pinned. Function and helper parameters also use registers
  (see "Parameters and return values").
- Locals survive waits, as in C#: where a local is still needed after a
  wait, the compiler saves and restores it through hidden storage.
  Decompiled locals that do not cross a wait stay plain locals; registers
  the original kept across a wait become `[Register]` fields.
- Register fields used across a wait while another entry of the same
  worker writes them give warning ATL0001, suppressible as any C# warning
  (`#pragma warning disable ATL0001`, `.editorconfig`).
- Types: `int`, `uint`, `short`, `ushort`, `sbyte`, `byte`, `float`,
  `bool`, enums, fixed-size arrays. `long`, `double`, `decimal`, `string`
  (outside `Debug`) are errors.
- The save game is the predefined `Save` class (`Save.StoryProgress`),
  from `docs/formats/save.md` and Fahrenheit's names; unnamed offsets are
  `Save.Unknown_0123`.

### Readability

- Natives are static classes and methods (`Msg.Say`, `Cam.Move`,
  `Chr.PlayMotion`); those acting on the worker itself are inherited
  members, called without a prefix (`PlayMotion`). XML doc comments carry
  what is known about each, so the IDE shows it on hover.
- Actor properties are properties: `Radius = 35f;`, `if (Hp < 100)`,
  `Party.Alive.Defense = 0;`. `Position = (x, y, z);` through a tuple
  conversion. Named arguments where they help (`frames: 15`).
- Float literals need C#'s `f` (`35f`); the decompiler writes them so.
- Values are typed by use: `Item[] Rewards = { Item.Potion, … }`,
  `Motion.Idle`, `Command.Bite`, `Target.Party | Target.Alive`.
- Story progress: `Story.S1340_WakkaJoinsParty`, the value zero-padded in
  the name so alphabetical order is progress order; auto-named from the
  script that sets each value, renamed by hand.
- Shared behaviour: workers with identical code across scripts (2,238 of
  12,622 are exact copies of another) become library base classes
  (`class Chest3 : TreasureChest { }`); the compiler copies the code back.
  Near-duplicates may become base classes with parameters.

### Text

- Messages by ID through the worker's `Text` indexer:
  `Msg.Say(Text[12]);`. An editor extension (VS Code, Rider) shows the text
  as inlay hint and hover, in a chosen language, from the player's message
  tables; the formatter can keep an optional `// "…"` comment for reading
  outside an editor.
- New messages: `Text.New("Nice throw!")`. A script holds one index for
  all languages, so every language's table gets the message at the same
  index: the mod's source language (`mod.toml`) gets the text, the others a
  copy marked untranslated. In mods the index is assigned when the
  launcher links, so the source keeps `Text.New`; in hand edits of the
  vanilla source the formatter may rewrite it to `Text[173]`. Translators
  work in the per-language TOML (`ffx text export/import`).
- Debug text is a real `string`, allowed only for `Debug.*`:
  `Debug.Print($"hp = {Hp}");`. It calls new natives in a group the game
  leaves empty (2, 3, a, e or f), provided by our hook or a Fahrenheit
  mod; without them the compiler refuses it or drops it on request.

### Control flow and semantics

- `if`/`else`, `while`, `do`, `for`, `?:`, `switch` with `case`,
  `default`, `break`, `goto case`; `goto` for flow that has no structured
  form.
- Logic: C#'s `&` and `|` on `bool` evaluate both sides, as ATEL's `land`
  and `lor` do, so the decompiler writes those; `&&` and `||`
  short-circuit as in C# and compile to branches. How an `int` used as a
  condition is written so that it compiles back to the same bytes (`x !=
  0` may or may not have been in the original) is settled in Phase 3.
- `int` is 32-bit and wraps (C#'s default `unchecked`; `checked` is an
  error); `float` is `f32`; unsigned compares follow the operand types.
- Not available, with an analyzer error naming the construct: classes
  with `new`, `string` (outside `Debug`), collections, generics beyond the
  reference assembly's, lambdas and delegates, exceptions, LINQ,
  recursion, anything from the .NET base library.
- Escape hatches for the round trip: `Asm("""…""");`, a raw string in the
  existing assembly syntax, for code the decompiler cannot express yet,
  and attributes that pin layout details (constant-pool order, a
  variable's storage area and offset, unknown header data).

## Toolchain

A .NET 10 solution in `ffx-rust`, `atel/` (MIT OR Apache-2.0, as the rest;
Roslyn is MIT):

| Project | Does |
|---|---|
| `Ffx.Atel.Bytecode` | script files, disassembler and assembler (our own `ffx-script` crate, ported); a test checks both agree on all 758 scripts |
| `Ffx.Atel.Game` | the reference assembly: natives, properties, enums, `Save`, `Story`, `Priority`, base classes, `Task`; generated from `ffx script natives --json` and the signature tables |
| `Ffx.Atel.Decompiler` | bytecode to C# syntax trees (Roslyn `SyntaxFactory`), the formatter |
| `Ffx.Atel.Compiler` | a Roslyn compilation of a project to ATEL: lowering, register allocation, layout |
| `Ffx.Atel.Analyzers` | the subset rules, ATL warnings, code fixes |
| `Ffx.Atel.Linker` | applies compiled mod packages to vanilla scripts in load order; a library (Fahrenheit can load it directly) and a NativeAOT command for the Rust launcher |
| `Ffx.Atel.Cli` | `atel decompile`, `atel compile`, `atel link`, `atel roundtrip` |
| `Ffx.Atel.Sdk` | NuGet package: reference assembly, analyzers and MSBuild targets, so `dotnet build` of a mod project writes the mod package |

## Compiler output

- One script file (`.ebp`, monster or battle file) with the rebuilt script
  block (vanilla source, hand edits).
- A mod package: the mod's compiled code and data only, with the vanilla
  points it attaches to (see "Mods").
- A package for runtime injection: the bytecode plus any message additions,
  so a debugger or mod can load it into a running game and extend the
  event's message table in memory (ctrl work `+0x34`).

## Mods

- The modder builds with their own game: `dotnet build` compiles the mod
  against the decompiled vanilla source and writes a package with only the
  mod's code, fields, entries and messages. No package contains game code.
- A mod changes an existing worker with `partial class Wakka { … }` and adds
  new workers, entries, fields and messages by name. The package refers to
  vanilla by script, worker, entry and field, plus a hash of each vanilla
  part it attaches to.
- The launcher links on the player's machine, with no compiler: it checks
  the hashes against the player's files, applies the enabled packages in
  load order, assigns every new number (entries, workers, variable
  offsets, message indices) and writes the results to a generated folder
  that the hook serves like any mod file. Vanilla files are never edited;
  disabling a mod is a relink without it.
- Patches on entries, after Harmony and Mixins: `[Prefix(nameof(OnTalk))]`,
  `[Postfix(…)]`, `[Inject(…)]` at a point inside an entry, `[Replace(…)]`;
  ordering with `[Before("mod")]` / `[After("mod")]`.
- Data edits per field (kernel tables, messages), after RimWorld and the
  Bethesda merge tools.
- `mod.toml`: `source_language`, `after`, `requires`, `incompatible`.
- The launcher shows a conflict report before the game starts: what two
  mods both touch and who wins. Additions and prefix/postfix chains combine
  automatically; replacements and same-field edits are reported conflicts.
  A hash mismatch (another game version, a mod built on edited vanilla) is
  reported too.
- Open: saved data for mods. The save has no known free space; storage 3
  can be redirected through the ctrl work's `+0x54` callback, which nothing
  uses, so the hook might give each mod its own saved variables in a side
  file. Needs research.
- File sizes are solved: the hook wraps `CDfileSize_CD` and `CDfileSize_PC`,
  and a mod file reports its own size; the vanilla tables are never shipped.
  To check: whether the PC build calls `CDfileSize_CD_EX` (not wrapped).
  Worth offering the wrapper to Fahrenheit.

## Phases

Each phase ends with a corpus test (`FFX_GAME_DIR`, skipped without it)
and numbers: scripts that round-trip, instructions inside `Asm`, `goto`
count, names placed.

0. **Measure the corpus** (2–3 days). Stack depth at labels and jumps; jump
   shapes; encoding choices (immediate vs pool, `func` vs `func_facc`,
   store modes, end variants); table and label order against code order;
   ternary and `for` patterns; `default` in switches; worker type meanings
   (types 1-6, and the `battle/btl` scripts); what an awaited request to
   the worker's own entry does at the same or a lower priority (oracle);
   fixed entry numbers per type; what each priority is used for; story
   values by the script that sets them; whether `UseCommand` checks the
   monster's command list; near-duplicate workers; whether anything stores
   entry numbers (saves); unreachable code; `CDfileSize_CD_EX` on PC.
1. **Native signatures and the reference assembly** (3–5 days). Argument
   count, kinds, result and polling for every native, from the Rust ports
   and from stack balance, compared; exported as JSON. Generated from it:
   `Ffx.Atel.Game`.
2. **Skeleton round trip** (1–1.5 weeks). The solution, `Ffx.Atel.Bytecode`
   with the cross-check against `ffx-script`, `atel decompile` and `atel
   compile`. Declarations plus every entry as `Asm("""…""")`; every script
   round-trips.
3. **Expressions and statements** (1 week). Stack code to expressions and
   calls, registers to locals and `[Register]` fields.
4. **Control flow** (1–2 weeks). `if`/`while`/`switch`/`goto case`, label
   order and branch polarity matching the original. Exit: no `Asm` left.
5. **Typing and naming** (ongoing). Enums by use, properties, text IDs,
   story constants, base classes and engine entries, Fahrenheit's names.
6. **Source layout.** Folders, one file per worker, `partial`, project
   granularity, library base classes for duplicated workers.
7. **The private repo.** `yutamago/ffx-atel-src`; a `generated` branch
   written only by the tool and a `main` branch for hand edits, merged with
   git; the round-trip check runs locally (it needs the game). Commits as
   Yutamago, no user paths.
8. **Tooling.** Analyzers and code fixes, the SDK package, the editor
   extension for message text (VS Code, Rider). No grammar, parser or
   language server of our own.
9. **Mod system.** Package format, `Ffx.Atel.Linker` (library and NativeAOT
   command), the launcher's link step, `mod.toml`, patch attributes,
   per-field data edits, the conflict report.
10. **Debug text and runtime packages.** The `Debug.*` natives in a free
    group (hook and Fahrenheit), the injection package.
11. **Documentation.** A language reference (which C# is Atel), the
    encoding rules, a first-mod tutorial.

Phases 0–4: about 5–7 weeks to a fully structured, byte-identical decompile
of every script. 5–11 follow and partly run alongside.

## Out of scope for now

- Running something other than the ATEL VM (the old L2 idea of running
  Luau, or running the C# on .NET). Atel compiles to ATEL bytecode, so the
  existing Rust interpreter and the oracle's byte parity keep working.
